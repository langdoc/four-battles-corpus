# Four Battles corpus

This corpus contain line-by-line aligned parallel text in several Uralic languages. The organisation of materials is still on-going, and especially Erzya needs to be converted to CoNLL-U format. Also the language tags need to be imported to CoNLL-U files of the other languages.

The corpus has been used in following works: 

> Bradley Jeremy, Kellner Alexandra & Partanen Niko 2018: Variation in word order in Permic and Mari varieties: a corpus-based investigation. *Proceedings of the symposium "Language contacts of the nations of Volga-Ural region", Cheboksary, 21â€“24.5.2018.*

> Janurik Boglarka, Kantele Simo & Partanen Niko 2017:  Three Uralic languages walk into a bar. Presentation in SLE 2017, Zurich.

Part of the Komi annotations are also in the Universal Dependencies [Komi-Zyrian treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-Lattice/).
